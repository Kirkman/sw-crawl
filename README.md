# Star Wars opening crawl ANSImation

![Opening crawl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kirkman/sw-crawl/master/output/__BLOCKTRONICS_Detention_Block_AA-23_Star_Wars_Animated_NFO_File.gif)

This animated ANSI .NFO file was released in the [Blocktronics](http://www.blocktronics.org) ["Detention Block AA-23"](http://www.blocktronics.org/downloads/artpacks/blocktronics_detention_block_aa-23.zip) artpack. Code by Kirkman (Josh Renaud).

If you'd like to read about the creation of this animation, read my 2017 blog post ["New ANSImation: Star Wars opening crawl"](http://breakintochat.com/blog/2017/05/25/new-ansimation-star-wars-opening-crawl/).

This animation runs in [Synchronet BBS](http://www.synchro.net) software's Javascript environment, and requires its Frame.js and Sprite.js libraries. It also uses the [perspective-transform.js](https://github.com/jlouthan/perspective-transform) library to skew the text of the opening crawl.

The code in this repository can be switched to output one of several crawls: Star Wars, Star Trek, and the Blocktronics pack.
